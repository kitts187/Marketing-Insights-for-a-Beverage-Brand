The project is about an imaginary beverage brand named CodeX.

CodeX

CodeX, a German beverage company, has recently expanded into the Indian market by launching their energy drink in 10 cities.

To gather consumer insights, CodeX conducted a survey in these cities, obtaining responses from 10k respondents.

The survey focused on consumer behavior, including purchasing habits, feedback on existing energy drinks in the market, as well as opinions on pricing and packaging.

The expected insights file and survey questions file is attached at the end of this article.

The Marketing Team has tasked their Data Analyst with transforming the survey results into actionable insights. 
They require specific insights and expect the Data Analyst to provide meaningful recommendations based on the data and external factors.

Recommendations for CodeX

1. What immediate improvements can we bring to the product?

Increase availability.

Address health concerns â€“ conduct an additional survey focusing on health-related questions (targeting the 455 respondents who are aware of our brand).

Introduce limited edition packaging.

Incorporate more natural ingredients, reduce sugar content, and add more flavors.

Enhance the positive response rate.

2. What should be the ideal price of our product? 

Consumers expect the price range to be between 50 and 150.

In cities such as Ahmedabad, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Pune, the expected price range is 50 to 99.

In other cities, consumers are willing to pay up to 150.

3. What kind of marketing campaigns, offers, and discounts we can run?

We can experiment with different pricing strategies in various cities. 

Also we can offer discounts on packs of 6 cans, making them more affordable.

Additionally, since each of these cities celebrates multiple festivals throughout the year, we can introduce gift set packs tailored for these occasions.

For marketing campaigns we can have -

Social Media

Influencer Marketing

E-commerce

4. Who can be a brand ambassador, and why? 

We have to consider certain things while choosing an influencer.

Impact

Budget

Relevancy

Virat Kohli would be a great choice as our brand ambassadors, considering these these factors.

5. Who should be our target audience, and why?

Statistics clearly show that most of our consumers are between the ages of 15 and 30.

According to the survey, 70% of our consumers are young people.
